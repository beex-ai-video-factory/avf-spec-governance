# REPOSITORY CONTEXT PROFILE — avf-workflow

## Mission
Own durable sequencing/waiting, activity orchestration and human escalation flow.

## Non-goal
Must not become canonical business database or implement browser selectors.

## Required authority
The frozen repository blueprint with the same R-number and the current frozen `avf-contracts` release.

## Implementation law
- consume only documented contracts;
- do not import another repo's private modules;
- do not change frozen schema locally;
- do not hide external effects;
- all material behavior requires tests;
- no self-approval.

## Human execution
Run prompts I00 through I12 in order.
When a frozen-spec ambiguity is found, stop the affected task and create `SPEC_CLARIFICATION_REQUEST`; do not guess.
